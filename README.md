# RattleTax
*~ Product for UBC BizTech's ProduHacks hackathon ~*

### Inspiration
It's tax season once again, and everyone, especially students, are feeling immensely stressed trying to file their tax 
forms correctly. What if there was a way to easily fill out your forms while also learning what each box means and 
maximize your tax returns? This lead to our application, RattleTax!

### What it does
RattleTax takes the user through a step-by-step process of filling out the tax form while educating what each step 
means. We would partner with institutions like universities so that it can easily be used by all college students, and 
it would only be a couple dollar increase in tuition! Use RattleTax to MAXIMIZE returns and MINIMIZE ssssstress!

### How we built it
We used Java for the back-end, and the Java Swing library for the front-end. To visualize what we would like for the 
final product, we designed our UI/UX with Figma.
